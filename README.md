This code contains a Google Colab notebook for training and running a model that classifies gender using facial images. The model uses a deep learning model to extract facial features and uses these features to predict gender.

Usage:

-Open the notebook in Google Colab.

-From the Colab "Runtime" menu, select "Run All".

-Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify test images.

Notes:

This model is trained on the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/gender-recognition-dataset dataset.
The accuracy of the model may vary depending on the test dataset.
This model is for educational purposes only and should not be used for commercial purposes.

Code:

This notebook contains the following code snippets:

Data loading: Used to load the Kaggle dataset.

Data preprocessing: Used to resize and normalize the images.

Model building: Used to create a deep learning model to extract facial features and predict gender.

Model training: Used to train the model on the Kaggle dataset.

Model evaluation: Used to evaluate the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.

GitHub Repository:

This code is available in a repository at https://github.com/.

Readme File:

The readme file contains instructions on how to use the model and a description of the code.
